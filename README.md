# Conda Recipes

Example recipes for the new conda build system.  Use

    conda build <recipe directory>

You have to use conda >= 1.7 
[conda](https://github.com/continuumio/conda).

See https://github.com/ContinuumIO/conda/blob/master/conda/builder/README.txt
for information on how to make a recipe, or just look at the examples here.
