For Windows, see
https://github.com/jyypma/nloptr/blob/master/INSTALL.windows. We have to build
nlopt with nloptr on Winodws.

You will need to install bash, which doesn't come with RTools.

If you get an error about creating /tmp, run `mkdir /tmp` inside bash.

You may need to download a newer config.guess file, as instructed.
